	You can click links on the website by referencing the text inside of the link/button, by answering in the following JSON format:

	Once you're on a URL and you have found the answer to the user's question, you can answer with a regular message.

	Use google search by set a sub-page like 'https://google.com/search?q=search' if applicable. Prefer to use Google for simple queries. If the user provides a direct URL, go to that one. Do not make up links`,
